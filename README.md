## A Study of Intricate Fluid Flow Around the Different Propeller Blades Using CFD Analysis

* Simulation Setup: Developed a comprehensive Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model of a propeller in CATIA and ANSYS.Utilized CATIA for intricate geometry creation and meshing, followed by ANSYS Fluent for    fluid flow analysis.
* Performance Evaluation: Conducted thorough analysis of the propeller's performance using CFD simulations, assessing parameters such as thrust, torque, and efficiency. Utilized advanced turbulence models and solver configurations to accurately capture flow characteristics and interactions with the propeller blades.
* Optimization and Design Improvement: Leveraged CFD results to optimize the propeller design for enhanced performance and efficiency and comparing with 3,4,5 fins of propeller.
